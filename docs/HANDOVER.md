# CarveFoundry — rolling development handover

> **Canonical continuity record.** Read this document and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) at the start of every new development chat. This file records verified state, active work, and next actions; it is not a claim that unmerged code is released.

## How to resume

1. Fetch `main`, this file, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and the latest open pull requests from GitHub. Never assume a previous chat's head SHA is current.
2. Verify whether the active PR below is still open, merged, or superseded; read its latest CI jobs and logs.
3. Resume the earliest unfinished checkpoint. Make changes on a feature branch; preserve working CNC safety behavior.
4. **Update this file in the same branch/PR whenever a meaningful step is completed.** Record exact PR/commit, tests actually run and outcomes, blockers, remaining items, and next action. Once CI passes and the PR merges, update the merged baseline and remove stale active-PR statements in the next PR.
5. Update `ROADMAP.md` in that same PR when a capability transitions from proposed to implemented. Do not mark UI controls, algorithms, or machine output as working until integrated and validated.
6. Before ending a development chat, write a concise checkpoint below including the exact GitHub links and the first action for the next chat.

**Terminology:** The project is CarveFoundry, an open-source CNC CAD/CAM application. Use vendor-neutral feature names, including generic *V-Carving* for the machining operation. Do not use third-party product branding in project identifiers, features, or UI labels.

## Verified merged baseline

- Repository: [newnetmp3/CarveFoundry](https://github.com/newnetmp3/CarveFoundry)
- Primary branch: `main`
- Last verified merged baseline: `66450ec2c2547caa84a7b7e6aa795e268d8b0fd4` (PR #70).
- [PR #61](https://github.com/newnetmp3/CarveFoundry/pull/61): retained analytic line, circular arc and cubic Bézier path foundation, native persistence, direct planar CAM use, basic vector snapping.
- [PR #62](https://github.com/newnetmp3/CarveFoundry/pull/62): close/open/split/join topology editing, analytic segment preservation, persistent CAM source UUID retargeting, Undo/Redo.
- The previous #62 validation reported Python 3.12 and 3.14 at **475 passed, 27 warnings**, plus green Ruff, Python compile, Rust formatting/Clippy/tests, installation-script syntax, and CarveWork tests. These results belong to #62, **not** to current development.
- Existing retained machining operations, preflight, GRBL-style separated cutter stages, sampled removal preview, and double-sided project preparation are documented in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Do not present them as machine-tested guarantees.
- Approximate historical roadmap assessment: native CAD ~50%, object-aware CAM ~85–90%, core router workflow ~82–85%, entire ten-part vision ~55%. These are subjective estimates, not measured acceptance coverage.

## Active development — angle constraint feedback and configuration

- Last verified merged `main`: `66450ec2c2547caa84a7b7e6aa795e268d8b0fd4` (PR #70).
- PR #70 Shift-constrained cubic handle dragging was merged after GitHub Actions run `37806907987` passed Python 3.12 and 3.14. Prior lint failure was fixed on that PR.
- Active branch: `feature/angle-constraint-ui-feedback`.
- Added blue angular-constraint marker to native control-handle overlay, shown only while Shift is constraining a control.
- Added configurable angular increment (1-180 degrees, default 45) in Direct Selection. The setting is persisted in `QSettings` and forwarded to the embedded native viewport. Preview and commit use the same configured increment.
- Added UI regression coverage for angle-step persistence and propagation. **CI and real KDE/Wayland interaction still unverified on this branch**.
- This does not claim true automatic tangent/perpendicular snapping or all-vector preview snapping. Rust conversion remains a separate planned parallel track.

### Next checkpoints

- [ ] Validate CI and merge angle configuration/feedback milestone.
- [ ] Fix any Qt regression or wrong mouse modifier behavior.
- [ ] Add true tangent/perpendicular acquisition with derivative-aware reference geometry.
- [ ] Build Rust-vs-Python performance/parity baseline, without changing proven machine export behavior.
- [ ] Continue trim/extend, fillet/chamfer and editable primitives; physical Wayland manual tests remain outstanding.

### Known boundaries and safety invariants

- Stock bottom-left is the default work XY0; Z0 is the top of stock unless the project explicitly changes it.
- Fixture/fence keep-outs and tool-radius clearance must remain in preflight.
- Keep distinct NC files for physical cutter stages; manual cutter swaps require Z re-probing.
- Preview/export must fail closed if enabled machining intent is stale or missing motion.
- Offline preflight cannot confirm actual machine work offsets, unknown clamps, holder collisions or controller state.
