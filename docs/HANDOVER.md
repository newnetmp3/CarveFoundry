# CarveFoundry — rolling development handover

> **Canonical continuity record.** Read this document and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) at the start of every new development chat. This file records verified state, active work, and next actions; it is not a claim that unmerged code is released.

## How to resume

1. Fetch `main`, this file, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and the latest open pull requests from GitHub. Never assume a previous chat's head SHA is current.
2. Verify whether the active PR below is still open, merged, or superseded; read its latest CI jobs and logs.
3. Resume the earliest unfinished checkpoint. Make changes on a feature branch; preserve working CNC safety behavior.
4. **Update this file in the same branch/PR whenever a meaningful step is completed.** Record exact PR/commit, tests actually run and outcomes, blockers, remaining items, and next action. Once CI passes and the PR merges, update the merged baseline and remove stale active-PR statements in the next PR.
5. Update `ROADMAP.md` in that same PR when a capability transitions from proposed to implemented. Do not mark UI controls, algorithms, or machine output as working until integrated and validated.
6. Before ending a development chat, write a concise checkpoint below including the exact GitHub links and the first action for the next chat.

**Terminology:** The project is CarveFoundry, an open-source CNC CAD/CAM application. Use vendor-neutral feature names, including generic *V-Carving* for the machining operation. Do not use third-party product branding in project identifiers, features, or UI labels.

## Verified merged baseline

- Repository: [newnetmp3/CarveFoundry](https://github.com/newnetmp3/CarveFoundry)
- Primary branch: `main`
- Last verified merged baseline: `4964e3a9e2934812d78f04ca4f37d9cf4d9dbc85` (PR #63).
- [PR #61](https://github.com/newnetmp3/CarveFoundry/pull/61): retained analytic line, circular arc and cubic Bézier path foundation, native persistence, direct planar CAM use, basic vector snapping.
- [PR #62](https://github.com/newnetmp3/CarveFoundry/pull/62): close/open/split/join topology editing, analytic segment preservation, persistent CAM source UUID retargeting, Undo/Redo.
- The previous #62 validation reported Python 3.12 and 3.14 at **475 passed, 27 warnings**, plus green Ruff, Python compile, Rust formatting/Clippy/tests, installation-script syntax, and CarveWork tests. These results belong to #62, **not** to current development.
- Existing retained machining operations, preflight, GRBL-style separated cutter stages, sampled removal preview, and double-sided project preparation are documented in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Do not present them as machine-tested guarantees.
- Approximate historical roadmap assessment: native CAD ~50%, object-aware CAM ~85–90%, core router workflow ~82–85%, entire ten-part vision ~55%. These are subjective estimates, not measured acceptance coverage.

## Active development — graphical cubic Bézier handles

- Previous [PR #63](https://github.com/newnetmp3/CarveFoundry/pull/63) merged successfully as `4964e3a9e2934812d78f04ca4f37d9cf4d9dbc85`. GitHub Actions run `37798718397` passed both Python 3.12 and Python 3.14 jobs.
- Current branch: `feature/bezier-viewport-handles` from the merged `main` baseline.
- Goal: display, pick and drag individual cubic Bézier controls using the existing native Wayland-compatible viewport input and Direct Selection event flow.

### Completed checkpoints on active branch

1. Render amber cubic handles and gray anchor-to-control guide lines in native OpenGL overlay, retaining green anchor markers.
2. Add pixel-distance handle hit testing and native pointer drag preview, with no separate event/proxy layer.
3. Forward handle drag completion through a new signal in `native_viewport.py`, `viewport_widget.py` and `main_window.py`.
4. Apply world-to-local drag through the merged `move_cubic_control` primitive. Keep transform-pivot compensation *inside* the undo/CAM invalidation transaction instead of correcting the transform afterward.
5. CI and actual Wayland GUI behavior **not yet verified**; do not count this branch as merged or production ready.

### Remaining checkpoints

- [ ] Add viewport/Direct Selection regression tests for handle pick, drag, undo, geometry persistence and stale CAM behavior.
- [ ] Run and inspect both CI Python lanes; resolve any Ruff, pytest or UI failures.
- [ ] Verify KDE/Wayland real mouse dragging when a physical environment is available.
- [ ] Update roadmap wording only after integrated behavior passes CI.
- [ ] Merge the active PR when green; update merged baseline and handover.
- [ ] Continue with tangent/perpendicular/grid snapping, angle constraints and snap indicators; then trim/extend, fillet/chamfer and editable vector primitives.

### Known boundaries and safety invariants

- Stock bottom-left is the default work XY0; Z0 is the top of stock unless the project explicitly changes it.
- Fixture/fence keep-outs and tool-radius clearance must remain in preflight.
- Keep distinct NC files for physical cutter stages; manual cutter swaps require Z re-probing.
- Preview/export must fail closed if enabled machining intent is stale or missing motion.
- Offline preflight cannot confirm actual machine work offsets, unknown clamps, holder collisions or controller state.
